This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions written in Hack: stack overflow due to lack of input validation. The `foo` function calculates the factorial recursively. Without input validation, calling it with large numbers causes the call stack to exceed its limits, resulting in an error. The solution demonstrates how to add a base case to handle large inputs or prevent overflow.
